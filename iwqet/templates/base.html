<h3>What is it?
</h3>

<p>
Mit'mit'a is an experimental application to help translate from
  English to Amharic.
In its final form, it will have two components: a rudimentary
  automatic translator (ተርጓሚ Tergwami) and a translation memory (ማከማቻ
  Makemacha).
In the current version, it consists of the translator only.
  </p>
  <p>
Mit'mit'a was designed to be used mainly by people who know both
  Amharic and English.
Users of the system enter texts that they to translate,
  and Tergwami proposes translations for phrases in the texts.
The users can accept or reject the suggestions of the system,
  entering their own translations if they want.
The system keeps a memory of the texts and the translations created by
  the users, and users have the option of saving the text at any point
  during the process.

<h3>How does it work?
</h3>

  <p>
  The translator Tergwami has a bilingual dictionary of phrases and
  basic knowledge of the grammar of English, the grammar of Amharic,
  and the relationship between them.
  For each English sentence entered by the user, it first analyzes the
  words,
  extracting their roots and grammatical properties.
  It think searches for phrases in the analyzed sentence that match
  phrases in its dictionary.
  Finally, for each phrase that it matches it produces one or more Amharic translations, using
  its knowledge of Amharic grammar and orthography.
  In the interface to Mit'mit'a, these results are displayed for the user.
  When the user corrects the output of the system or replaces its
  translation with a different one, Tergwami learns from this
  feedback, improving its dictionary and possibly also its grammatical
  knowledge.
  In addition, Mit'mit'a adds the translation given by the user to
  Makemacha, its translation memory, so that the translation can be
  used in future sessions when another user is translating a similar sentence.
